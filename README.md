# Synesthesia-generator
Synesthesia is a condition in which two of a person's senses are neurologically connected, for instance, sound and vision.
In this case, I "see" a color in my mind's eye that corresponds to every letter of the alphabet.
This is a simple jQuery exercise done in an attempt to visualize each color.
